# Score-Keeper

**Created By:** Andreas Campan 
Free to use - Open source code 

**Purpose:** 
This app was created to help keep score for game nights. The motivation and inspiration behind this app was my pregnant wife who told me “I hate using the notes app to keep score”
 
**Instructions:**
- Type in the name of a player and press enter or click the add button. *(Max 10 characters long but unlimited players can be added)*
- Each name will have a card containing a score value, dealer button, starter button, delete button and number buttons. 

**Buttons:** 
- +/- Button – changes the color of the number buttons to toggle addition or subtraction from the score. 
- 1, 5, 10 Buttons – increase or decreases the score by the selected button value depending on its status. 
- Starter and Dealer Selections – Click on the radio buttons to keep track of who started a round and who dealt that round. 
- X Button – Press the X button to delete a player card from the list.

**Status:** 
- Red = Subtraction 
- Green = Addition
