# Score-Keeper

**Created By:** Andreas Campan 
Free to use - Open source

**Purpose:** 
This app was created to help keep score for game nights. The motivation and inspiration behind this app was my pregnant wife who told me “I hate using the notes app to keep score”
 
**Instructions:**
- Type in the name of a player and press enter or click the add button. *(Max 10 characters long but unlimited players can be added)*
- Each name will have a card containing a score value, dealer button, starter button, delete button and an input for the score 
- Once the score is typed in the score input box, press or click enter to add it to the player's score (see below for details)

**score Input** 
- Any number up to 7 digits long can be added
- Decimals can be used
- To add a negative value, type a minus sign (-) followed by the number or push the red minus sign
